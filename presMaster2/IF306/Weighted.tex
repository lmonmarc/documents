\begin{frame}{Weighted}
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$]Each interval has a positive weight
\item[$\bullet$]Goal : given $k$ colors, find a coloring maximizing the total weight
\item[$\bullet$]Idea : reducing the problem to a network flow problem (minimum cost flow)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{From intervals to network}
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$]Endpoints sorted $\mathrm{x_{1}<x_{2}<\dots<x_{r}}$
\item[$\bullet$]Intervals sorted by increasing right endpoints $\mathrm{I_{1}, I_{2},\dots,  I_{n}}$
\item[$\bullet$]Construction of the network
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Vertices : $\mathrm{s=v_{0},\ \ v_{1},\ \dots, v_{r},\ \ v_{r+1}=t}$
    \item Clique-edges between $\mathrm{(v_{i},v_{i+1})}$ with $\mathrm{cost = 0}$ and $\mathrm{capacity = k}$
    \item Interval-edges between the two endpoints of an interval with $\mathrm{cost = -1 \times weight}$ and $\mathrm{capacity = 1}$
    \end{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$]1 unit of flow = 1 color
