\section{Introduction}

Nowadays complex applications (with several components) often cohabits in the same virtual machine. This leads to resources consumption problem e. g. when one component is faulty and burns the CPU or reaches the I/O bandwith limit. Monitoring is used to detect such problems and localize/isolate the faulty components. But monitoring introduces a substancial overhead, which may causes itself faulty behaviours of some components. The goal of this paper is to present a new monitoring framework, with low overhead at runtime and complete monitoring of a component only when a problem is already suspected in it. Global overhead is reduced by an average of 80\%.
